# Project Setup

- I have used project setup for MVP structure. along with use of riverpod.
- Have feature sentric approch for folder structure. where all new feature have their separate MVP folder structure.
- As of now we have only one screen cum feature of CryptoList so folder structure is simple

# Exra Information

- I have created separate packages for internationlization for common use for centralized language support for multiple sub app
- I have created network request separte from main app to provide same apis for other or sub apps if any we include in feature
- I have made common widgets as well for separate package along with theme data and AssetManagement for icons and common images.
- Also for routing management i have integrated GoROuter but have not done much user in this demo app as i have only one page to work on.
